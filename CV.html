            by 15%. I consistently designed tailored solutions to address
            specific customer needs, leading to a 25% improvement in customer
            retention rates and receiving positive feedback from 85% of surveyed
            clients. Furthermore, my effective troubleshooting and clear

            significantly improved team efficiency through targeted training
            sessions. This led to a notable increase in overall team
            productivity. Additionally, I created detailed reports and analyses
